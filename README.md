# 🦙 Lutra: Fine-tuning Your Own LLaMA Model for Telegram Bots

Welcome to **Lutra**, a hands-on educational project designed to help beginners fine-tune their own LLaMA language model using **Unsloth** and connect it to a functional **Telegram bot**.

This project provides a **clear, step-by-step journey** — from setting up the environment, processing data, training with Unsloth, to deploying locally or via Google Colab.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Lutra** is a simplified learning repository aimed at developers and students who:
- Want to understand how LLaMA models are fine-tuned using their own data
- Want to deploy and test a custom chatbot using Telegram
- Struggle with environment setup, model training, and local/Colab execution

This project is **not intended for production use**, but rather for **educational and portfolio-building** purposes.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- ✅ Set up Unsloth and Ollama for LLaMA training
- ✅ Prepare a basic Q&A-style dataset for training
- ✅ Fine-tune a LLaMA model using Unsloth
- ✅ Connect the fine-tuned model to a Telegram bot
- ✅ Provide Jupyter notebooks that work both **locally** and in **Google Colab**
